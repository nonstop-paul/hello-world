# hello-world
I'm a Graphic Designer of 30+ years most of my carreer has been working with Finnish Global companies offering Brand Management and designing and producing their B2C/B2B client magazines and marketing material for print.

Print is 'dead' basically so I became involved with WordPress and building sites using Visual Builders like DIVI, Elementor, Brizy and Oxygen. Recently I'm looking to expand my skill set and study Fullstack Frontend UI. So here I am Visual Studio Code and Git installed and rearing to go.

Lord have mercy :-)
